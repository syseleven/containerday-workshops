# Deployment with Ingress and TLS

## Preparation

* Before you begin with the actual exercise please make sure to follow these steps to work in your own environment:

  ```shell
  # enter your name
  # example:
  # export YOURNAME=janedoe
  export YOURNAME=<YOURNAME>
  kubectl create ns ${YOURNAME}
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=${YOURNAME}
  ```

* Clone this repository to your working station and change into the directory for the following exercises

---

## Task

Deploy a full web application to your namespace which uses external-dns, ingress-nginx and cert-manager.

* First, adjust your individual hostname in `web-application/deployment/ingress.yaml`

* Deploy application to your namespace

  ```shell
  kubectl apply -f web-application/deployment/web-application.yaml
  ```

* Deploy ingress resource to your namespace

  ```shell
  # Do not foget to set you personal namespace!
  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=${YOURNAME}
  
  kubectl apply -f web-application/deployment/ingress.yaml
  ```

## Verify

* Wait a minute until DNS has propagated
* Visit URL https://web-application-YOURNAME.workshop.metakube.org

## Conclusion

* we learned how powerful the combined tools external-dns, ingress-nginx and cert-manager are
* it is easy to publish applications and get certificates and a DNS name directly from a k8s resource
